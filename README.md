# SQL-Projects-and-Code---Principles-of-Data-Engineering
This repository includes project descriptions/guidelines, SQL Code to solve the tasks challenged to my team, and explanations on our work. 
Complete Project: The entirety of this project still needs to be completed. We are currently working on the final part of this project, however, 
the guidelines for Project 2.3 can still be found in the repository. This was a 3 Part Project that expanded in complexity and knowledge as the 
course continued throughout the semester. 

Project 2.1 includes creating Tables for a hypothetical company that needed to collect, store, and organize data. It includes the establishment 
of attributes, primary keys, foreign keys, independencies, as well as an appropriate entity relationship diagram (ERD).  

Project 2.2 includes multiple files found in the ‘data’ file in the repository. We had to upload all of these .SQL files and CSV files. From 
this, we were tasked with solving the problems given to us by designing our own queries to retrieve the information requested. 

Project 2.3: The guidelines for the final part of this project is uploaded to the repository, the final version is now complete and I am happy to provide it if anyone is interested.
